# GTECH_731_03
Homework assignment 3 for GTECH 731. The goal of this homework is to become familiar with managing Python dictionaries and lists, while also getting some familiarity with geojson and other text file formats.  

One option for doing this is to find the area around where you live and to get information about it from the PLUTO database (if you live in New York City).  The polygon tool at http://chriswhong.github.io/plutoplus lets you do this and download the data in different formats. Try selecting these fields and downloading the data:

bldgarea
lotarea

If you sum up the building area and the lot area, you should be able to generate the proportion of your neighborhood that falls inside buildings.  There are many other fields - feel free to explore any other attributes you find interesting, or using other data if there is something that is more interesting to you.  The main requirement is that it be a text file, and that you extract and manipulate data from it to calculate something using the data in the text file.
